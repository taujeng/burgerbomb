# To Do
- [ ] For the Menu page, the rows are not fully aligned: compare the item-text
- [ ] Chipotle's color theme: Header (white), body (white), footer (brown)
- - [ ] Thinking of just adding a light brown for body, white header/footer
- [ ] 1024x768: Landing Page dimensions are off. landing-hero has too much white space
- [ ] 


# Ideas
- [ ] When ordering a burger: cutout image of a burger. When you select the buns, then the cutout image w/ buns. ect.
- - [ ] Take into account that user might deselect buns after selecting meat, so would need a picture for every possibility.
- [ ] Alternatively, could have a carousel of classics (premades w names)
